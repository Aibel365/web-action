## helper to generate release

By making edits on this you can create PR on github.

And by adding "GENERATE_RELEASE" in title, github action will make new release, like this:
* `chore: GENERATE_RELEASE`

> all releases are major, to make it simples for others to use

* DD.MM.YYYY - WHY YOU DO THE RELEASE  (just clear it if it gets to long)
* test if first version works - Ill skip PR
